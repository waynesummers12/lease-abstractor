# 🔎 SEO_EXECUTION_PLAN — SaveOnLease V1

This document defines the **exact SEO execution plan** for SaveOnLease after V1 launch.

The goal is **high‑intent traffic → uploads → payments**, not generic traffic.

This plan is deliberately narrow, repeatable, and execution‑focused.

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY SEO GOAL

Generate **high‑intent tenant traffic** searching for help with:

* CAM reconciliation
* NNN overcharges
* Audit rights
* Expense caps
* Lease disputes

Success metric:

> **Lease uploads and paid audits**, not pageviews.

---

## 🧠 SEO STRATEGY (LOCKED)

We pursue **distress‑based search intent**, not informational fluff.

Target users are:

* SMB tenants
* CFOs / controllers
* Franchisees
* Multi‑location operators
* Anyone surprised by CAM / NNN bills

These users:

* Search late in the process
* Have high urgency
* Convert quickly

---

## 🧱 SITE STRUCTURE (FINAL)

### Core Buckets

* `/marketing/*` → SEO landing pages
* `/app/*` → Product flow
* `/success` → Post‑payment confirmation

**Do not change routing structure.**

---

## 📄 TIER 1 PAGES (DEAL‑BLOCKERS)

These are the **highest priority** pages.

Each page must:

* Address a specific pain
* Clearly explain tenant risk
* Funnel to “Upload Lease” CTA

### Required Pages (Already Live / Locked)

* `/marketing/cam-reconciliation`
* `/marketing/cam-nnn-overcharges`
* `/marketing/nnn-audit-rights`
* `/marketing/audit-window-deadlines`
* `/marketing/cam-expense-caps`
* `/marketing/cam-admin-page`

These pages should **never be deleted**.

---

## 📄 TIER 2 PAGES (SUPPORTING INTENT)

These support internal linking and long‑tail capture.

Examples:

* `/marketing/common-cam-fees`
* `/marketing/non-allowable-cam-nnn-expenses`
* `/marketing/nnn-expenses-explained`
* `/marketing/pro-rata-share-explained`
* `/marketing/cam-reconciliation-checklist`

Purpose:

* Rank for variations
* Build topical authority
* Funnel users inward

---

## 🔗 INTERNAL LINKING RULES

Every marketing page MUST:

* Link to **Upload Lease** CTA
* Link to 1–2 related marketing pages
* Use descriptive anchor text (not “click here”)

Example:

> “Tenants often miss their **CAM reconciliation audit window**…”

---

## 🧲 CTA STRATEGY (MANDATORY)

All SEO pages must drive to:

```
/app/step-1-upload
```

CTAs should emphasize:

* Surprise bills
* Missed audit deadlines
* Recoverable overcharges

Approved CTA language:

* “Upload your lease to see what you’re overpaying”
* “Check your CAM risk in minutes”
* “Find hidden CAM & NNN overcharges”

---

## 🧪 CONTENT RULES

Allowed:

* Clear explanations
* Tenant‑first framing
* Plain English
* Concrete examples

Forbidden:

* AI‑sounding filler
* Long intros
* Legal disclaimers
* Academic tone
* Over‑optimization

Each page should answer:

> “What mistake could cost this tenant real money?”

---

## 📊 ANALYTICS (SEO‑FOCUSED)

Track only:

* Page → Upload clicks
* Upload → Checkout
* Checkout → Payment

Ignore vanity metrics:

* Bounce rate
* Time on page
* Scroll depth

Revenue is the signal.

---

## 🧠 CONTENT EXPANSION RULE

New pages are added **only if**:

* A keyword shows buyer intent
* It maps directly to a tenant risk
* It can reasonably drive uploads

If not → do not publish.

---

## 🛑 WHAT WE DO NOT DO (IMPORTANT)

* No blog
* No news
* No thought leadership
* No generic lease education
* No backlink campaigns (initially)

This is **conversion SEO**, not content marketing.

---

## 🧭 ITERATION LOOP

Every 30 days:

1. Identify top landing pages
2. Identify which pages lead to uploads
3. Improve copy + CTA on winners
4. Kill or ignore losers

No mass rewrites.

---

## 🔒 LOCKED STATUS

* SEO structure is locked for V1
* Pages are added, not refactored
* Routing stays unchanged

V2 may revisit SEO architecture.

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

SaveOnLease SEO exists to:

> Capture distressed tenants and convert urgency into revenue.

Everything else is noise.
