🔒 V1 Locked Checklist — SaveOnLease

Status: ✅ V1 is LIVE
Rule: If an item below is checked, it must not be changed.

🔒 V1 LOCK CONDITIONS (ALL MUST BE TRUE)

V1 is considered frozen only when all of the following are true:

Deployment

✅ Vercel production build passes without errors

✅ No Supabase errors during prerender or build

✅ Worker reachable and responding

✅ Upload → analysis → payment → PDF works end-to-end

✅ At least one successful production deployment confirmed

➡️ Once all are true → V1 is frozen

🚨 HARD NO-CHANGE ZONE (ABSOLUTE)

These items are not negotiable in V1.

Architecture

❌ Do NOT change frontend stack (Next.js App Router)

❌ Do NOT change worker stack (Deno + Oak)

❌ Do NOT move logic between frontend and worker

❌ Do NOT refactor “for cleanliness”

❌ Do NOT consolidate services

❌ Do NOT “simplify” Supabase usage

Supabase Rules (CRITICAL)

❌ Frontend must NEVER require Supabase at build time

❌ No getSupabaseServer() in frontend

❌ No Supabase imports in prerendered pages

❌ No SSR Supabase access

❌ No new Supabase env vars added to Vercel

Violation = broken production build

✅ ALLOWED CHANGES (SAFE ZONE)

These are explicitly allowed and encouraged.

UI / UX

Copy edits

Button text

Headings

Spacing / typography

Colors

Icons / illustrations

Loading states

Error message wording

Marketing & SEO

Add new /marketing/* pages

Edit existing marketing copy

Improve CTAs

Add internal links

Add schema (FAQ / HowTo)

Metadata (title, description)

Analytics (Client-Only)

Page views

Upload started

Analysis visible

Checkout started

PDF downloaded

Analytics requirements:

Client-side only

Lazy-loaded

Zero SSR impact

🧪 WHAT TO TEST AFTER ANY CHANGE

Before deploying, all must pass:

npm run build passes locally

/app/step-1-upload loads

File upload works

Redirect to step-3 works

Analysis appears

Checkout redirects correctly

PDF downloads successfully

❌ If any fail → stop and revert

🛑 STOP CONDITIONS

Immediately stop work if:

You see “supabaseUrl is required”

Build fails during prerender

Vercel shows repeated failed deployments

You feel tempted to “just refactor one thing”

👉 When in doubt → do nothing

🔁 DEPLOYMENT RULES

One deploy per fix

No rapid retries

No guessing in production

Fix locally first

Green build = stop touching code

🧠 DECISION FILTER (USE THIS)

Before changing anything, ask:

“Does this increase conversions or clarity without touching architecture?”

❌ No → don’t do it

⚠️ Maybe → defer

✅ Yes → proceed carefully

🧾 ONE-LINE RULE (PRINT THIS)

V1 exists to prove demand, not engineering elegance.

🧠 DECISION CHECKLIST (BEFORE FIXING)

Ask:

Does this stop users from paying?

Does this break the funnel?

Does this risk introducing new bugs?

Can this wait one week?

If unsure → DO NOT FIX

🗂 BUG TRACKING PRACTICE

Log bugs in plain text (Notion / GitHub issue / doc)

Group by:

Blocking

Revenue

Cosmetic

Only Blocking + Revenue are actionable

🚦 ESCALATION RULE

If a bug requires:

More than 30 minutes of thought

More than 3 files

Any architectural discussion

⛔ STOP
⏸ Document it
➡️ Defer to V2

🔒 CHANGE CONTROL

This policy may ONLY be modified if:

V1 is generating revenue OR

V2 planning has begun

Until then:

Stability > Cleverness

✅ STATUS

🟢 V1 is LIVE

🔒 Stack is LOCKED

🧠 Bugs are triaged, not chased
