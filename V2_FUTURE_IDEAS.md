> This document captures forward-looking ideas ONLY. Nothing here should be implemented until V1 metrics justify expansion. Treat this as a strategic parking lot, not a roadmap.

## Guiding Rule for V2

V2 exists **only if V1 proves traction**.

**Traction =**

* Consistent paid audits
* Low support burden
* Clean checkout → PDF → download flow

If V1 breaks or becomes complex, **pause V2 entirely**.

---

## V2 Theme: Depth, Not Breadth

V2 does **not** mean:

* More upload types
* More AI features
* More dashboards

V2 means **higher leverage per audit**.

---

## 1. Audit History & Accounts (Optional)

### What

* Optional email-based account
* View past audits
* Re-download PDFs

### Why

* Repeat tenants
* Multi-location operators

### Guardrails

* No auth until repeat usage exists
* No password resets v2.0

---

## 2. Audit Window Tracking

### What

* Track CAM reconciliation dates
* Alert tenants when dispute window is closing

### Why

* Time pressure increases conversion
* Clear tenant ROI

### Guardrails

* Alerts only (email)
* No calendar sync initially

---

## 3. CAM Benchmarking (Aggregated)

### What

* Compare CAM line items against anonymized benchmarks

### Why

* Strong differentiation
* Data moat over time

### Guardrails

* Read-only insights
* No landlord comparisons shown publicly

---

## 4. Contingency-Based Recovery Offering

### What

* Optional "Recover for me" upsell
* % of recovered dollars

### Why

* High ROI tenants
* Strong word-of-mouth

### Guardrails

* Manual intake
* Human-in-the-loop only

---

## 5. Multi-Lease Upload (Enterprise-lite)

### What

* Upload multiple leases
* Batch analysis

### Why

* SMB chains
* Franchise operators

### Guardrails

* Separate pricing tier
* No bulk UI complexity

---

## 6. Lease Health Monitoring (Long-Term)

### What

* Periodic CAM drift alerts
* Insurance / tax spike warnings

### Why

* Subscription potential

### Guardrails

* Read-only monitoring
* No automation actions

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

❌ Full accounting systems
❌ Landlord-facing tools
❌ Negotiation automation
❌ Chatbots / AI assistants
❌ Embedded finance

---

## Kill Switch

If any V2 idea:

* Increases support load
* Slows audit turnaround
* Breaks SEO funnel clarity

→ **DO NOT SHIP**

---

## Final Principle

SaveOnLease wins by:

* Being tenant-first
* Being simple
* Being trusted in moments of stress

V2 must **amplify** that — never dilute it.
